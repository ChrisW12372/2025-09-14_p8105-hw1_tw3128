# Problem 1

## Load the Package and Dataset

First, I load the package.

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1
    ## ✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.3.0
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1
    ## ✔ purrr     1.1.0     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

Second, I load the dataset “early_january_weather” from the package.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Discription

- The dataset “early_january_weather” shows the Hourly meteorological
  data for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013, which
  contains 15 variables. These variables are origin, year, month, day,
  hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
  pressure, visib, time_hour. Here are some brief descriptions below.

  - Variable “origin” means the weather station where it locates.

  - Variables “year”, “month”, “day” and “hour” are the time of
    recording.

  - “temp” and “dewp” are temperature and dewpoint in Fahrenheit.

  - “humid” means the relative humidity. “wind_air”, “wind_speed” and
    “wind_gust” refer to wind direction, speed and gust speed
    respectively.

  - “precip” means the precipitation in inches.

  - “pressure” means sea level pressure in millibars.

  - “visib” means visibility in miles.

  - “time_hour” means date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date.

- There are 358 samples and 15 variables.

- The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

## Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +           geom_point() + 
  labs(
    x = "Time (hour)",
    y = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
    color = "Humidity",
    title = "Temperature-Time with Humidity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Problem 2

## Create a Dataframe

``` r
problem2_df = 
  tibble(
    vec_norm = c(rnorm(n = 10)),
    vec_logic = c(vec_norm > 0),
    vec_cha = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("H", "L", "M", "H", "M", "M", "L", "H", "M", "L"))
  )
```

Note: In the vector “vec_factor”, “H”, “M” and “L” are short of “High”,
“Medium” and “Low” respectively.

## Calculate the Mean

``` r
pull(problem2_df, vec_norm) |>
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.1263667

``` r
pull(problem2_df, vec_logic) |>
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
pull(problem2_df, vec_cha) |>
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_cha)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
pull(problem2_df, vec_factor) |>
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I think only numerical vectors have mean values. If some of the elements
in a vector are strings, then perhaps we cannot use R to calculate the
mean of the vector.

## “as.numetic” Function

``` r
as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_logic)
as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_cha)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_factor)
```

We can convert factors into numeric values, but not strings. I think
that’s probably because there are some logical relationships in factor
vectors, which can be converted into integers like “1” or “2” or “3”
etc. However, if a vector contains only strings without any logic, then
the result will be “NA”.
