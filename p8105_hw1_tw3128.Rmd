# Problem 1
Firstly, we need to load the package.

```{r}
library(moderndive)
```

Secondly, I load the dataset "early_january_weather" from the package.

```{r loading_the_data}
data("early_january_weather")
```


Thirdly, I do some simple calculations about the size of this dataset and\
the mean of temperature.

```{r some_simple_calcularions}
num_row = nrow(early_january_weather)
num_col = ncol(early_january_weather)

num_row
num_col


mean_temp = mean(early_january_weather$temp)

mean_temp
```
