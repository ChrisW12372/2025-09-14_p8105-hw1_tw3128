Firstly, we need to load the package. I am using "include = FALSE" to make sure\
that this loading process will not be seen by viewers in the final .html file.

```{r include = FALSE}
library(moderndive)
```

Secondly, I load the dataset "early_january_weather" from the package.

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```
